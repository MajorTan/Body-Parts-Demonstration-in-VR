# Body-Parts-Demonstration-in-VR
We are making a system in Unreal Engine 4.26.2 that will display the human body, brain, eye, lungs, and digestive tract system in VR using OpenXR, an open-source add-on supported by Unreal Engine. Learning and teaching with VR is one of the technologies at the forefront of having the potential to improve learning and teaching. In recent years, virtual reality technologies have advanced significantly, opening up many new learning opportunities. Outside of the Classroom, virtual reality enables a more tailor-made learning experience. This paper describes the development and discussion of a virtual reality application for teaching medical students about human body parts in virtual reality. This application will allow medical students to closely observe and understand different human organs in a 3D view. We are doing this for the benefit of medical students and doctors. And to prove that VR technology can be used for advanced and low-resource practical learning.
